DEAR READERS,

THE CODES AND MEMBERS IN THIS PDS CORRECTS THE BUGS THAT CAN BE FOUND
IN THE CBT FILE 554 AUTHORED BY MR. MITCHELL MARX & MS. PENELOPE DAVIS.

JCLS/PROCLIB MEMBERS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE BOOK AND THE CBT FILE 554
WERE ADDED/CODED FOR EASE OF TESTING.

A QUICK AND SIMPLE PROGRAM EDEBUGC WAS CODED TO INVOKE THE ESTAE
ROUTINE (EDEBUG). THIS WAS CODED TO FACILITATE THE TESTING OF
EDEBUG.

EDEBUGC ALSO CONTAINS AN ELEGANT EXAMPLE OF CODING A TABLE FOR
TRT AND/OR TR INSTRUCTION PURPOSES. NOT MY ORIGINAL THOUGH BUT VERY
ENCHANTING WHEN IT GENERATES THE CHARACTER CODES FOR YOU. I WISH I
COULD FIND THE BOOK WHERE I SAW THIS TECHNIQUE. I LOST TRACK OF IT.

I ABSOLUTELY ENJOYED READING AND LEARNING FROM THE BOOK OF THE AUTHORS
MR. MITCHELL MARX AND MS. PENELOPE DAVIS.. MVS POWER PROGRAMMING.

MVS MAY BE AN OLD NAME AND TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER,
THE PROGRAM CODES AND TEXT BOOK ARE STILL VALID AND USEFUL FOR
THE LATEST Z ARCHITECTURE.

IN APPRECIATION FOR THEIR GREAT WORK,
I HAVE DILIGENTLY READ THE TEXT BOOK
MANY TIMES AND ALSO FOR REFERENCES AND DILIGENTLY TESTED
THE PROGRAM CODE
AND DILIGENTLY CORRECTED THE ERRORS AND BUGS. THE BOOK DOES CONTAINS
SOME TYPO ERRORS THAT MAY OR CAN BE CORRECTED IN THE FUTURE.
NEVERTHELESS, I TREASURE THE BOOK AND THE GREAT WORKS OF THE AUTHORS.

SINCERELY,
ED TOBIAS.
